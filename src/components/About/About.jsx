        <h3>Benefits for Register Home Buyer's Associations</h3>
        <p className="">
          While social media groups and informal groups by home buyers are good
          for raising collective voice against builders, homebuyers should get
          their group registered to form a registered, collective and legal
          body. Some of the benefits of registering the home buyer association
          are: <br /> <br />
          <span className="heading_1">
            Representation at Consumer Forums:
          </span>{" "}
          Home buyers associations can file cases on behalf of its members at
          various forums including Consumer forums. Cumulative value of cases,
          when filed by association, can easily exceed one crore and cases can
          directly be filed in NCDRC. In a recent landmark judgement of Lotus
          Panache Welfare Association vs 3C Company, NCDRC cleared the deck for
          home buyers associations to file cases for delay penalty etc. <br />
          <span className="heading_1">Legal Recognitions:</span> Builders do not
          take homebuyer groups seriously unless their group has legal
          recognition. In their view, groups are formed and dissolved every
          month. A legally recognized and registered association gives an
          impression of the seriousness of the people involved. A legally
          recognized group can present the grievances of home buyer's groups at
          various forums. <br />
          <span className="heading_1">Credibility:</span> When groups are
          registered, the office beares are also subjected to rules and
          regulation of society. This gives a sense of credibility and security
          to those wanting to join the associations. <br />
          <span className="heading_1">
            Collect Money for the Movement:
          </span>{" "}
          Once the association is registered, homebuyers can open a bank account
          in the name of association. This brings transparency in the collection
          of funds and expenses. More people shall be interested in joining an
          association when they have an option to deposit money online for the
          movement. <br />
          <span className="heading_1">Safeguard the leaders:</span> Not everyone
          has the time and energy to consistently work for the benefit of
          others. Builders try to target the frontrunners in the movement
          against injustice. A registered association can put their weight
          behind such leaders and extend their monetary support when needed.
          Actions taken by leaders in such scenarios shall be seen as the
          actions taken to protect members of such associations. The builder
          shall not have an option to single out someone and project as if those
          frontrunners have vested interest. <br />
          <span className="heading_1">
            Avoid and fight defamation cases:
          </span>{" "}
          We explained defamation cases being filed by builders against
          individuals. A registered association can always stand up against such
          tactics by builders and back those who are targeted by builders.{" "}
          <br />
        </p>
        <h3>Documents Required for Registration</h3>
        <p>
          <li>
            Request letter to register a society under Societies Registration
            Act 1860{" "}
          </li>
          <li>
            Two sets of Memorandum of the association including a list of
            proposed Governing Body and list of desirous persons
          </li>
          <li>
            Two sets of rules and regulations framed for the functioning of the
            organisation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Affidavits (on Rs. 2/- stamp paper) from president/Secretary of the
            Society regarding the name/title of the society.
          </li>
          <li>Copy of residence proof of all desirous persons.</li>
          <li>
            Proof of ownership of the registered office of the society and no
            objection certificate (on Rs. 2/- stamp paper).
          </li>
        </p>
        <h3>What Dispute can Arise out of this? </h3>
        <p>
          About 66 percent of all litigations in Indian courts are related to
          properties, and most of the Disputes pertain to the title of the
          immovable property. Disputes related to a property, often arise
          through claims from legal heirs, co-owners, disputes over easement
          rights, wrong representation by the seller and improper description of
          the property in the title deed. If the dispute surrounding a property
          reaches an indefinite impasse, the bank takes over the property and
          auctions it off to settle all disputing parties. <br /> A dispute over
          property may also arise if the seller in the property transaction,
          after receiving earnest money or a deposit, proceeds to give quotes to
          other buyers. In this case, the previous buyer can approach the court
          and contest the title of the property. In other disputes, buyers may
          question the delay in the delivery of projects by a developer. <br />{" "}
          If a buyer were to purchase a property inherited by another person,
          either by gift deed or by a will, it may also lead to disputes. An
          inherited property may be subject to conditions of the will, probate,
          letters of administration or succession certificate.
        </p>
        <h3>Types of Disputes in Real Estate </h3>
        <p>
          Disputed properties may arise from many issues and may involve parties
          such as your neighbour, landlord or tenant, trespasser, homeowner
          associations and even family members. Due to the diverse array of
          stakeholders involved in these disputes, a large portion of legal
          claims filed involve property disputes. Legal remedies sought range
          from damages to cover the plaintiff's losses, ordering one party to
          cover the repair work and preventing parties from making changes to
          the property such as building a 'spite fence'. <br />
          Some of the common property disputes that you could come across
          include: <br /> <br />
          <span className="heading_1">
            Case 1: Disputes between buyers and builders
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Any property transaction is supposed to be a contract meant to be
          honoured by all parties involved. But, many times, builders tend to
          fail in meeting their end of the agreement, which leaves the buyer in
          the lurch. Indefinite delays in possession are the primary cause for
          disputes between buyers and builders. Unscrupulous builders tend to
          extort money from the buyer, transfer the project to another developer
          without proper permission from the society and fail in following the
          relevant regulatory compliances.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="heading_1">Things to Check: </span> <br />
          When it comes to a project that is under construction or delayed
          possession, follow these tips:
          <li>
            You should check more than just the Commencement Certificate
            obtained by the builder. The builder must have the approved plans in
            place and all No Objection Certificates from the relevant regulatory
            authorities.
          </li>
          <li>
            You must ask the builder for a definite schedule for construction to
            complete so that claims can be made for construction-related
            property bookings.
          </li>
          <li>
            Visit the construction site and consult with the authorised
            individuals of the housing society to investigate the builder's
            credibility.{" "}
          </li>
          <li>
            Check the builder's past record, the number of projects completed
            and any pending litigations against the builder
          </li>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="heading_1">
            Case 2: Delayed payment to housing society by the builder
          </span>{" "}
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          If the builder is carrying out the redevelopment of a housing society,
          they must pay the rent to the members of the housing society. Till the
          building in the housing society is revamped, the members must be given
          temporary accommodation. If these conditions are not adhered to, it
          might lead to serious disputes between the buyer and the builder. In
          times of a financial crisis, the builder might declare insolvency, and
          the project ends up being stalled.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="heading_1">Things to Check:</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Below are some steps to take so that non-payment of dues by the
          builder does not affect your home buying experience:
          <li>
            You can opt to get the lump sum amount instead of periodic rents
            from the builder, in case the builder decides to jump ship before
            providing possession.{" "}
          </li>
          <li>
            With the substantial amount of money received, you may invest in the
            open market to make a profit or find alternate accommodation.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can include a heavy penalty clause or a guarantee of alternate
            accommodation in the consent agreement signed with the builder.
          </li>
        </p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          At present, the need of Home Buyer Association has been vastly
          increased, and the government also needs this process in the real
          estate sector to decrease the graph of disputes. Some fast-track
